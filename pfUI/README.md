## DLL Enhancements

Since pfUI 6.0.0 includes integrations with client-side DLLs for enhanced functionality. These DLLs are permitted on Octo WoW:

### [ClassicAPI](https://github.com/brues-code/ClassicAPI)

Provides:
- C_NamePlate - Event-driven nameplates (no more per-frame WorldFrame scanning) with real per-plate unit tokens and GUIDs
- C_UnitAuras - Replaces over 3k lines of hand-rolled aura tracking
- C_Spell - Replaces thousands of hardcoded spell names for each locale and powers castbar
- Real cast bars - Actual cast/channel timing, spellID and interrupt state for any unit (C_Spell.UnitCastingInfo)
- Focus - A genuine `focus` unit plus `/focus` and `/clearfocus` (FocusUnit / ClearFocus)
- C_EquipmentSet - Full Equipment Manager with GUID-tracked gear sets (tells apart duplicate/enchanted items)
- Instant Bag Sorting - C_Container.MoveItem / SwapItems instead of cursor pickup/drop
- Sell junk in one call - C_MerchantFrame.GetNumJunkItems / SellAllJunkItems
- Real item data - C_Item counts, quality, sell price and item info by ID
- GUID-based targeting - Nameplates, mouseover and focus resolve by GUID, not by name text
- Faster, safer profile sharing - Engine-side serialize/compress/base64 via C_EncodingUtil
- C_Timer - After / NewTicker replacing hand-rolled OnUpdate throttles
- Feign death, shapeshift and quest-item detection via real API calls
- Mouseover Unit Frames
- Click-casting
- Loot Roll History (/loothistory)
- New item highlighting
- Plenty other functions

### [Nampower](https://github.com/brues-code/nampower)

Provides:
- Spell queue indicator

### [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW)

### [UnitXP_SP3](https://github.com/brues-code/UnitXP_SP3)

## FAQ
**What does "pfUI" stand for?**  
The term "*pfui!*" is german and simply stands for "*pooh!*", because I'm not a
big fan of creating configuration UI's, especially not via the Wow-API
(you might have noticed that in ShaguUI).

**How can I donate?**  
[You can buy me a coffee if you'd like](https://buymeacoffee.com/brues)

**How do I report a Bug?**  
Please provide as much information as possible in the [Bugtracker](https://github.com/brues-code/pfUI/issues).
If there is an error message, provide the full content of it. Just telling that "there is an error" won't help any of us.
Please consider adding additional information such as: since when did you got the error,
does it still happen using a clean configuration, what other addons are loaded and which version you're running.
When playing with a non-english client, the language might be relevant too. If possible, explain how people can reproduce the issue.

**Where is the happiness indicator for pets?**  
The pet happiness is shown as the color of your pet's frame. Depending on your skin, this can either be the text or the background color of your pet's healthbar:

- Green = Happy
- Yellow = Content
- Red = Unhappy

Since version 4.0.7 there is also an additional icon that can be enabled from the pet unit frame options.

**Can I use Clique with pfUI?**  
This addon already includes support for clickcasting. If you still want to make use of clique, all pfUI's unitframes are already compatible to Clique-TBC. For Vanilla, a pfUI compatible version can be found [Here](https://github.com/shagu/Clique/archive/master.zip). If you want to keep your current version of Clique, you'll have to apply this [Patch](https://github.com/shagu/Clique/commit/a5ee56c3f803afbdda07bae9cd330e0d4a75d75a).

**Where is the Experience Bar?**  
The experience bar shows up on mouseover and whenever you gain experience, next to left chatframe by default. There's also an option to make it stay visible all the time.

**How do I show the Damage- and Threatmeter Dock?**  
If you enabled the "dock"-feature for your external (third-party) meters such as DPSMate or KTM, then you'll be able to toggle between them and the Right Chat by clicking on the ">" symbol on the bottom-right panel.

**Why is my chat always resetting to only 3 lines of text?**  
This happens if "Simple Chat" is enabled in blizzards interface settings (Advanced Options).
Paste the following command into your chat to disable that option: `/run SIMPLE_CHAT="0"; pfUI.chat.SetupPositions(); ReloadUI()`

**How can I enable mouseover cast?**  
On Vanilla, create a macro with "/pfcast SPELLNAME". If you also want to see the cooldown, You might want to add "/run if nil then CastSpellByName("SPELLNAME") end" on top of the macro.

**Everything from scratch?! Are you insane?**  
Most probably, yes.
